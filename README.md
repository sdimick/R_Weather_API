# Weather API with R

Going to explore how to use API's with R by starting with [Weather Underground's API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs) that is free to use for development.

Going to reference [Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc)'s [send-email-with-r](https://github.com/jennybc/send-email-with-r#prep-work-related-to-gmail-and-the-gmailr-package) repo on how to send an email via gmail.
